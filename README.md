# n_factorial_asm
A simple assembly program I wrote that calculates n! (n factorial) for any given n value.

## To Assemble and Run n_fact:
First clone the repo:

    git clone https://github.com/morgan-legare/n_factorial_asm.git

Enter the n_factorial_asm directory:

    cd ~/n_factorial_asm

Then assemble n_fact by running:

    make

You can now run n_fact:

    ./n_fact
